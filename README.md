# Squared-tiles-gaming-project
This game name is squared tiles. This is an AI game. Here AI plays against the user. First, we have a 6X6 matrix which is our game play space. User tries to fill the square using 3X3 or 2X2 matrix.  

The first user gives his move then AI gives his move. If user give a move but AI does not give any move he will lose. Suppose user press   2 for moves  then AI gives press 2 for moves when a user tries to next move he does not give any move so he will lose.
